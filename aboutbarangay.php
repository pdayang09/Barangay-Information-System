						<h3>BARANGAY SAN ISIDRO GALAS, QUEZON CITY</h3>
						<p>
							Barangay San Isidro Galas was created June 25, 1975 in manner of creation by Executive Order No.34 PDs 86 & 210. Galas got its name from the Tagalog word “ Galasgas” meaning rough and rugged terrain. Early in the 1900’s, Galas was a vast tract of sparsely populated rugged farmlands under the jurisdiction of what was then Caloocan, Rizal. It was then bounded on the South by what is now Batanes St. towards D.Tuazon, Manila Q.C. boundary; on the west, by D.TuazonSt; on the North Nicanor Ramirez and Bayani St. and on the East by the San Isidro St., which old timers called “ Espangkrit” The only roads that existed then were Bayani and Cordillera St.
</p><p align = "justify">In 1911, Ciriaco de Jesus settles in Galas where he establishes his trade and prospered as a silver & goldsmith specializing in religious icons. Being Childless, Ciriacobrought with him his nephews to whom he passed his skills as a craftsman.
Farmers would turn to be de Jesus for financial help during the planting season. He was then recognized as head of a core group of civic leaders among whom were his nephews Gaudencio&Rufino, Cirilo “Amang” Dayao and Flaviano“ Mianong” Samson.
As the Community grew, the group felt the need for a patron saint and what better choice than SAN ISIDRO LABRADOR- the patron saints of farmers. Since early 1920’s his feast day was celebrated every 15th May. If the date fell on a weekday, celebrations were held on the nearest Sunday, be it before or after the 15th. The De Jesus clan had a statue of San Isidro made for the occasion. Now, the Feast Day of San Isidro Labrador is celebrated every 3rd Sunday of May.
</p><p align = "justify">When Quezon City was created in the late 1930’s, Galas was integrated as part of the city. Without an official parish within the city, the Galas community continued to hold religious activities at the Holy Trinity Parish Church in Balic-Balic, Sampaloc.
Galas were later divided into several Barangay after the declaration of Martial Law in 1972. The first appointed Barangay Officials were Jose Dayao as Brgy. Captain with Kgds. Gabriel Hernandez, Jaime Emaden, Urbano Caguiguin ,Dely Nipas, Eric Belmonte (brother of Mayor Sonny Belmonte and father of Vincent Belmonte), Trinidad Lim and Purification Magsakay. 
The Brgy. Secretary was Rodolfo Lacandazo while Esperanza Tabora served as Brgy. Treasurer. The community that took care of the San Isidro image became BARANGAY SAN ISIDRO. </p><p align = "justify">Today, local folks, especially the “old timers “, still regard and refer to Barangay
